            <p>Firstly, I love my ideal partner very much because she is enough clever to keep my heart cheerful and
                always helps me when I need her, especially in my studies.</p>

        <div class="column-item sidebar-two">
            <h2>Sidebar two</h2>
            <p>Therefore I have to put my education first and when I have problems in studying, we can share with each
                other to solve together. Last but not least, my woman always respect my parents by greeting them, asking
                them whenever she helping them in some situations.</p>

            <p>Everybody has a plan for future. Though future is uncertain and many times unpredictable, I believe that
                to some extent our future depends on our actions on past and present. In the future, I want to run a
                mega shopping mall business where my involvement would not be mandatory to run the daily business and I
                would enjoy my time by visiting different places of the world.</p>

        <div class="feature-item">
            <h2>Feature 2</h2>
            <p>After I finished my graduation, I started working for a small company. Now I am working for a large
                multinational company I have planned to work till I become 36 and then I will take early retirement. The
                money I will inherit and the amount I am currently saving per month should allow me to start a business.
                I have planned to start a big shopping mall.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature-item">
            <h2>Feature 3</h2>
            <p>Hopefully, I will enjoy the retirement and the trips. Though I am not sure about the future but I have
                already planned for it. Because I believe proper planning and initiation is the half of the total task
                and fulfilling dream. I have already taken some steps towards achieving my future plan.</p>

            <p>My best friend is my classmate at school. She and I have been studying together since we entered school
                in kindergarten. </p>

                    all that has been covered at school. We also play badminton together in the evenings.</p>
